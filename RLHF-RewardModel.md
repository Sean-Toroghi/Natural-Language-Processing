<h1>Reward model</h1>

# Overview
The concept of alignment is crucial for enhancing the performance of language models. Alignment involves optimizing an AI systemâ€™s behavior to reflect both the designers' intentions and user expectations [1-5]. In the realm of large language models, this concept is realized through Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF), which enables the model to generalize more effectively [6-7]. RLHF consists of two primary stages: the first involves gathering preference data from a diverse set of crowdsource workers to train a reward model, while the second employs reinforcement learning to refine the language model to maximize this reward.

However, reward models face several significant challenges. Firstly, the input data used to train these models often contains noise, including disagreement, incorrect preferences, and ambiguity. Human decision-making is inherently noisy, which can obscure the true underlying preferences and affect the reward model's performance. Addressing this noise is essential for improving the effectiveness of the reward model. Secondly, reward models typically struggle with generalization. A model trained on a specific set of examples may perform poorly when encountering out-of-distribution data [10]. These limitations can introduce instability into the reinforcement learning process and increase the overhead costs associated with iterative RLHF when new preference data emerges.
